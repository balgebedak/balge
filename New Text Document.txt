Perfect — let’s write a **detailed technical plan** for your project **`Balge`**, which you can save, refer to, and send back to me anytime to resume.

This plan is scoped to support:

* ✅ Any kind of software (web, mobile, CLI, ML, etc.)
* ✅ Multi-file projects
* ✅ Auto library installation per language
* ✅ Docker-based secure execution
* ✅ Custom API usage (OpenAI, Google, Firebase, etc.)

---

# 📘 Project Blueprint: **Balge**

**AI-native app & software factory** that plans, generates, configures, executes, and packages full codebases using any tech stack or APIs, all from a single prompt.

---

## 🧱 1. SYSTEM STRUCTURE

### ➤ **Frontend (Next.js)**

* Prompt input: “Make me an app like Uber”
* Chatbox / live messages from AI
* File tree viewer + Monaco editor
* Console: test results + execution output
* Config upload (API keys, service configs)
* Download project `.zip`
* “Run app”, “Install deps”, “Test project” buttons

### ➤ **Backend (FastAPI)**

* `/plan`: analyzes the prompt, returns required services & steps
* `/generate`: builds project codebase
* `/install`: installs language dependencies
* `/run`: executes the main script inside Docker
* `/test`: runs test files (`test_*.py`, `*.spec.js`, etc.)
* `/download`: returns zipped project
* `/logs`: (future) for real-time Docker logs

### ➤ **Execution Environment**

* Docker containers per language
* Auto-setup: Python, Node, Go, Rust, etc.
* Inject `.env`, install from `requirements.txt`, `package.json`
* Safe, isolated, disposable

---

## 🧠 2. FLOW EXAMPLE

1. **User:**
   *“Build me a Stripe-powered donation app using FastAPI + React + Auth0. I’ll use Firebase for DB.”*

2. **Balge returns a `plan`:**

   ```json
   {
     "needs": ["Auth0 credentials", "Firebase config", "Stripe API key"],
     "tech_stack": ["FastAPI", "React", "Firebase"],
     "entry_file": "main.py",
     "files": ["backend/", "frontend/", ".env.example"]
   }
   ```

3. **User uploads `.env` file and credentials**

4. **User clicks “Generate”**
   → Balge writes full codebase across folders

5. **User clicks “Install”**
   → Balge builds Docker, installs deps

6. **User clicks “Run”**
   → Executes entry file in container

7. **User downloads ZIP or deploys**

---

## 🧩 3. TECHNOLOGIES SUPPORTED

| Language | Install strategy                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Python   | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Node.js  | `npm install`                     |
| Go       | `go mod tidy`                     |
| Rust     | `cargo build`                     |
| Java     | `maven` or `gradle`               |
| Bash/C++ | Custom                            |

Support for Dockerfile override, GPU containers, and cloud runners planned.

---

## 🔑 4. API & Credential Handling

* Balge doesn’t generate or fetch keys itself.
* It requests credentials per plan:

  * OpenAI key
  * Firebase service account
  * Google Maps key
  * Stripe secret key
  * Auth0 client ID/secret
* User uploads `.env` or fills UI form

---

## 🧠 7. WHAT MAKES **BALGE** DIFFERENT

* 🧩 Works with **any prompt**, no fixed templates
* 🔐 Keeps credentials private (never leaves local)
* 🧠 Uses AI for **multi-service app scaffolding**
* 🐳 Runs in safe Docker sandbox
* 🛠 Generates **modular, ready-to-run codebases**
* 📦 Exports full zipped projects
* 🧰 Prepares you for local use or cloud deployment

---

### 📝 You Can Save This Plan and Send It Back Later

When you're ready to resume, just say:

> “Let’s continue Balge, here’s the plan”

---

Would you like to begin now with Step 1 — creating the new folder structure and init files for `Balge`?



🔥 Let’s kick off **Balge** from the ground up.

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Scaffold Project Structure

Here’s the basic structure we’ll start with:

```
balge/
├── frontend/        → Next.js app
├── backend/         → FastAPI app
│   ├── main.py
│   └── codegen.py
├── runner.Dockerfile
├── output/          → Where generated projects go
├── .env             → For any needed config
└── README.md
```

---

### ✅ 1. Create base folders

In your terminal or file explorer:

```bash
mkdir -p balge/{frontend,backend,output}
cd balge
touch backend/main.py backend/codegen.py runner.Dockerfile .env README.md
```

---

### ✅ 2. Backend setup

Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux

pip install fastapi uvicorn openai python-multipart
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

### ✅ 3. Docker runner setup

Paste this into `runner.Dockerfile` in the root:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
    if [ -f "requirements.txt" ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

---

### ✅ 4. FastAPI bootstrap (`main.py`)

Paste this into `backend/main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Balge backend is alive"}
```

---

### ✅ 5. Run the backend

Make sure you’re in the backend folder and the venv is activated:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then open your browser:
➡️ [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

You should see:

```json
{ "message": "Balge backend is alive" }
```

---

Ready for Step 2: build the `/plan` route where Balge returns what it needs from you based on your app idea?
Perfect — here's a **clear roadmap for Balge**, broken into focused steps to reach the complete product. This will guide us step by step without losing track of the goal.
